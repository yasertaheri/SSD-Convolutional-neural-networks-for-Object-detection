# SSD-Convolutional-neural-networks-for-Object-detection

Implemetation of single shot object detection with Convolutional neural networks

I have used the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset for end-to-end training of the implemented deep convolutional neural netwotk (Augmented VGG16 network) for the aim of object detection. The batch_size of 32 is considered and Batch-normalization is employed to speed up the training.  

The following results are obtained after training the deep neural network by only images containing person in order to detect people in the images.






In progress... for detecting objects from 20 different categories.
